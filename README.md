# Live Coding on Twitch

So I have decided to live code on Twitch some projects to help others that are getting involved in football analytics.

### Replacing Nicolas Pépé with Stolen Data

Nicolas Pépé is having a great 2018/19 season with Lille and is frequently linked with a lot of big clubs. He will surely need replacing in the summer window! I scrap data from Soccerway and FiveThirtyEight's Global Club Soccer Rankings to try and find some replacements from Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey.
